# Gas Laws Simulator

This simulator demonstrates key gas laws and thermodynamic principles by visualizing gas behavior in a 2D container with a movable piston. The simulation uses simplified physics to illustrate how changes in volume and temperature affect the gas pressure and the speed of its molecules.

## Features

- **2D Container & Piston:**  
  A rectangular container is drawn with a fixed left wall and a movable right wall (piston). The effective volume is adjusted by dragging the piston slider.

- **Gas Molecules:**  
  Gas is represented by small circles (molecules) that move randomly within the container. Their speed is proportional to the gas temperature.

- **Interactive Sliders:**
  - **Piston Slider (Volume):**  
    Moving the piston changes the container's volume. When the volume decreases (compression), the gas temperature increases, and vice versa.
  - **Temperature Slider (Energy):**  
    Adjusting the temperature slider simulates adding or removing energy from the system, directly setting the gas temperature without changing the volume.

- **Gauges:**  
  Real-time displays show the current **pressure**, **temperature**, and **volume** of the gas.

## Physics Behind the Simulator

### Adiabatic Process Coupling

When you move the piston, the simulator models an adiabatic-like process. In an adiabatic process (no heat exchange with the surroundings), the relation between temperature and volume is given by:

\[
T \, V^{\gamma - 1} = \text{constant}
\]

In this simulation:
- The effective length \( L \) is defined as:
  \[
  L = \texttt{piston\_slider.value} - \texttt{container\_left}
  \]
- The energy state of the gas is characterized by the constant:
  \[
  K = T \, L^{\gamma-1}
  \]
  where:
  - \( T \) is the temperature,
  - \( \gamma \) is the heat capacity ratio (typically \(\gamma = 1.4\) for diatomic gases).

Thus, when the **piston slider** is moved (changing \( L \)), the temperature is recalculated as:

\[
T = \frac{K}{L^{\gamma-1}}
\]

### Energy Addition Without Volume Change

When you move the **temperature slider**, you are directly adding or removing energy from the system:
- The temperature \( T \) is set directly by the slider.
- The energy constant \( K \) is updated accordingly:
  \[
  K = T \, L^{\gamma-1}
  \]
- The volume remains unchanged.

### Pressure Calculation

The pressure in the simulator is computed using a simplified version of the ideal gas law:

\[
P \sim \frac{n\,T}{V}
\]

where:
- \( n \) is the number of gas molecules,
- \( T \) is the temperature,
- \( V \) is the volume (computed as the effective length \( L \) times the container height).

A scaling factor is applied to ensure the numerical values are visually significant in the simulation.

## How to Run the Simulator

1. **Install Pygame:**  
   Make sure you have Pygame installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

2. **Run the Application:**  
   Save the simulator code in a file (e.g., `gas_simulation.py`) and run it with:
   ```bash
   python gas_simulation.py
   ```

3. **Interact:**  
   - **Drag the Piston Slider:** Observe that reducing the volume increases the gas temperature (simulating adiabatic compression) and vice versa.
   - **Drag the Temperature Slider:** Directly add or remove energy from the gas. The volume remains fixed while the pressure and the motion of the gas molecules change.
